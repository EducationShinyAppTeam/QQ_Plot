Chapter: Linear Regression
Description: This app shows the uses of QQ plots, as well as an interactive tool to display how different distributions affect the plots.
LearningObjectives: c(
    "The student will first learn about the background of QQ Plots and what they are used for.  From there, they will be able to play 
    around with interactive QQ Plots to see how various things affect them (sample size, skewness, number of paths.)"
